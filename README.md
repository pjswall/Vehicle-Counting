# Vehicle-Counting
The vehicle counting procedure offers accurate data on traffic flow, vehicle collisions, and traffic peak times on highways. Using digital image processing technologies on traffic camera video outputs is an acceptable strategy for achieving these goals. The Kalman filter is used to create a vehicle counter-classifier based on a mixture of video-image processing methods such as object detection, edge detection, frame distinction, and the Kalman filter. The proposed technique has been implemented using the Python programming language. The method's accuracy in vehicle counts and classification was assessed, yielding a classification accuracy of around 95% and a vehicle detection target error of about 4%. Vehicle Counting, Vehicle Detection, Traffic Analysis, Object Detection, Video-Image Processing are some of the terms used in this paper.
